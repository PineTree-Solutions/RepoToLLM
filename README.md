# RepoToLLM (Export Repo To Markdown)

Export Repository to a single markdown file.
Copy paste the file once generated into LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, or any other AI tool. They can easily understand it and help you develop faster.
The markdown file contains:

- A detailed repository structure overview.
- A list of all files with their respective paths.
- Complete code content for each file.

---

## Usage

1. Open your Python project in VS Code.
2. Run the command `Repo To LLM` from the command palette.
3. The extension generates a `REPO_TO_LLM.md` file in the root of your repository.
4. Copy and paste the content from the `REPO_TO_LLM.md` file into LLMs like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini to enhance development:
   - Copy the content of the file and paste it into any LLM provider (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini...).
   - Once you paste the code, ask any question about it.
   - Develop faster and more efficiently.
   - Fix bugs faster.
   - Share your repository overview with team members.
